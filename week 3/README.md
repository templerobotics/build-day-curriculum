# Week 3: Servos

This week is about the servo that we will be using on the robot.

- [Servo](./servo.ino)
  - Instructions: Create a program that pans the servo from left to right continuously. At the beginning of the program, the servo should center itself for 5 seconds so the ultrasonic distance sensor can be calibrated at the center of the rotation path.
